			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>he Flight Safety Foundation was established in 1947. The Flight Safety Foundation is a non-profit non-governmental
				organization and one of the most influential professional international organizations in the field of aviation safety.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>The foundation plays a unique role in identifying global security issues, determining priorities, and solving these
				issues through data collection and information sharing, education, advocacy, and communication. The foundation's effectiveness
				in eliminating common security reasons, cultural and political differences has won the respect of the world ("About the
				Foundation - Flight Safety Foundation", 2020). The common benefits of safer air travel continue to inspire individuals
				and organizations to transcend competing interests and move towards common goals.</p>
			<p>
				Today, members include more than 1,000 organizations and individuals in 150 countries/regions. The foundation is located
				in Alexandria, Virginia, USA, and has a regional office in Melbourne, Australia.</p>

			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>The target users of the Flight Safety Foundation are all people in the world who benefit from air travel. Especially
				various staff engaged in the aviation industry. Develop safety standards. Provide independent technical assistance. Disseminate
				safety information. Solve community issues fairly. Share leading practices. Global representative industry. Promote security
				solutions.
			</p>

			<p>The needs of users are that the Flight Safety Foundation can objectively intervene in accidents in the aviation industry.
				On April 14, 1945, Laura Taber Barbour boarded the Pennsylvania Central Airlines (DC) DC-3 and passed through the turbulent
				West Virginia skies when an electric storm swept Cooper's Rock State Forest near Morgantown. When the plane crashed into
				Cheating Hill, she had only 17 passengers and only 3 crew members ("About the Foundation - Flight Safety Foundation",
				2020). All people on board were killed. In 1956, her husband, the late Dr. Clifford E. Barbour and his son Cliff expanded
				the silent insurance settlement and established the Laura TaberBarbour Aviation Safety Award through collaboration with
				Jerome Lederer and Gloria Heath of the Flight Safety Foundation In recognition of his honor.

		<section id="ideation">
			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>Ideation helped me improve the initial sketches, combining their advantages and avoiding their shortcomings by combining
				different concepts. I will divide it into three parts to complete the final concept.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mood Boards</li>
				<li>Structure</li>
				<li>Iteration</li>
				<li>Final Sketches</li>
			</ul>


			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>I found some materials that can inspire my design. The basic elements are all related to the aviation industry. The
				website is based on the sky, and the design is as simple as possible. Highlight the beautiful meaning of the sky and
				encourage people to pay attention to aviation safety.</p>
			<figure>
				<img src="moodboard.png" alt="moodboard"/>
        <figcaption>This is moodboard.</figcaption>
      </figure>


			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>I combined with moodboard to come up with two concepts and drew their structure diagram. The concept of each structure drawing is different. I drew their homepages separately on the basis of the structure diagram.</p>
        <figure>
				<img src="structure1.PNG" alt="structure1"/>
        <figcaption>This is Structure1.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
				<img src="structure2.PNG" alt="structure2"/>
        <figcaption>This is Structure2.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>The first concept mainly focuses on horizontal browsing, which is the most familiar operation logic for users. The difficulty of getting started is small, and users can quickly find what they want.</p>

    <figure>
				<img src="iteration.PNG" alt="iteration"/>
        <figcaption>This is the first concept.</figcaption>
      </figure>

    <p>The second concept is a trendy design that makes full use of the vertical space of the page. Putting the navigation bar vertically can leave most of the page space for the page.</p>

      <figure>
				<img src="iteration2.PNG" alt="iteration2"/>
        <figcaption>This is the second concept.</figcaption>
      </figure>

    <p>Taking into account the gradual increase in the proportion of mobile users, the design of the second concept is not very suitable for mobile users (Handley, 2019). For the sake of portability, the mobile terminal has a small user interface. If the navigation bar is placed vertically, the user's operation difficulty will increase.</p>

    <p>Final sketches combining two concepts.</p>

    <figure>
				<img src="page1.PNG" alt="1"/>
        <figcaption>This is page1.</figcaption>
      </figure>

    <figure>
				<img src="page2.PNG" alt="2"/>
        <figcaption>This is page2.</figcaption>
      </figure>

    <figure>
				<img src="page3.PNG" alt="3"/>
        <figcaption>This is page3.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
				<img src="page4.PNG" alt="4"/>
        <figcaption>This is page4.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure>
				<img src="page5.PNG" alt="5"/>
        <figcaption>This is page5.</figcaption>
      </figure>


		</section>
		<section id="designs">
			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>On the basis of final sketches, a more detailed typesetting was added. Using a symmetrical design can make the content and images have a better match. The design of Wireframes allows me to quickly and easily make the layout of each page and adjust it. In the final Mockup link, add more details and make High-Fidelity Prototype.</p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>In the Wireframe section, I determined the basic structure of each page and planned the area of ​​each section. At the same time, the pages on the mobile terminal have also been relatively optimized to facilitate users to view content effectively.</p>

				<img src="w5.png" alt="w5"/>
        <figcaption>This is the fifth page.</figcaption>

      <p>Next are the wireframes on the mobile termina.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>This is the first page.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>This is the fifth page.</figcaption>
      
      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <p>Adding more details and content on the original basis of wireframe to form part of mockup. In the style part, adding suitable fonts and colors makes High-Fidelity Prototype a complete improvement. At the same time, in the content section, insert relative text descriptions and pictures. Finally completed High-Fidelity Prototype.</p>
